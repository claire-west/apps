# App Hub
An extensible javascript-based app hub to facilitate a variety of loosely-coupled web apps. Includes:

- hash-based navigation and routing
- dynamically loaded scripts, html, iframes, and css
- shared google sign-on across all apps

#### Apps
- a browser-based version of my original Twitch Stream Utility
- a lightweight utility to browse anime from Crunchyroll
- an in-progress pinboard app
- an old, somewhat unstable dynamic form builder
